# Task Description
You will be provided with text from the internet.
Evaluate whether the text contains any backward-chaining behavior, where the writer is working towards a goal but starts from the goal and works backward.

Backward-chaining in mathematics might look like:
- "To solve this equation, let's start with what we want to prove: x = 4. Working backward, if x = 4, then x² - 5x + 4 = 0 must be true. Let's verify this."
- "If we want to find a function whose derivative is 2x + 3, let's start with the desired result and work backward. The derivative of x² + 3x + C would give us 2x + 3."
- "To prove this triangle is a right triangle, I'll start by assuming the Pythagorean theorem holds (c² = a² + b²) and check if our side lengths satisfy this condition."
- "In this optimization problem, we know the maximum value occurs when the derivative equals zero. If we set f'(x) = 0 and solve for x, we can find our critical points."
- "To determine the initial velocity, I know the ball reaches a height of 20 meters. Working backward from this final state using the kinematic equation h = vt - 0.5gt², I can solve for the initial velocity v."

Count the number of distinct backward-chaining instances and provide the count between the tags `<count></count>`. If the reasoning does not contain any backward-chaining behavior, provide a count of 0 as `<count>0</count>`.
