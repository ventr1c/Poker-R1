# Task Description
You will be provided with text from the internet.
Evaluate whether the text contains any explicit subgoal setting, where the writer breaks down the problem into smaller, intermediate goals.

Subgoal setting in mathematics might look like:
- "First, we need to find the derivative of f(x), then we can determine where it equals zero."
- "To solve this system of equations, let's first isolate x in the first equation, then substitute it into the second."
- "Let's tackle this proof in three parts: (1) prove for the base case, (2) establish the induction hypothesis, and (3) prove the inductive step."
- "To calculate this integral, I'll first use substitution to simplify, then apply the power rule."

If you find any subgoal steps, please count them and provide the count between the tags <count> </count>. If the text does not contain any subgoal setting, please provide a count of 0 as <count>0</count>.
