# Task Description
You will be provided with text from the internet.
Evaluate whether the text contains any verification steps. We want to mark instances where the writer explicitly checks their own work, such as by comparing the result to a known value or by checking the result of a calculation.

Verification steps in mathematics might look like:
- "Let's check our answer by substituting x = 3 back into the original equation."
- "To verify this is correct, I'll differentiate the antiderivative and confirm it matches the original function."
- "Let's test our formula with a simple case: when n = 1, we get f(1) = 2, which matches our expected result."
- "To ensure this solution is valid, I'll check if it satisfies all the given constraints."

If you find any verification steps, please count them and provide the count between the tags <count> </count>. If the text does not contain any verification steps, please provide a count of 0 as <count>0</count>.
