# Task Description
You will be provided with text from the internet.
Evaluate whether the text contains any backtracking behavior, where the writer realizes a path won't work and explicitly goes back to try a different approach. An example of backtracking is: "Let me try again", "Wait", "I made a mistake", or "we need to try a different sequence of operations". We want to mark instances where the writer abandons a thought and backtracks to a previous computation.

Backtracking in mathematics might look like:
- "I started with the wrong formula. Let's use integration by parts instead."
- "This approach leads to a contradiction. Going back to the original equation..."
- "I see the error in my calculation. Let's recalculate using..."
- "This algebraic manipulation isn't simplifying as expected. Let's try factoring differently."

Count the number of distinct backtracking instances and provide the count between the tags <count> </count>. If the writer does not backtrack, please provide a count of 0 as <count>0</count>.

# Task Format
